Aconcagua is a gigantic mass of rock, not picturesque in the traditional Alpine sense, but magnificent by its size alone. It dominates the sky east of Santiago, Chile's capital city, and is visible from the Pacific coast, 100 miles away.
Though the mountain's summit crest and radiating ridges are largely windswept free of snow, large glaciers fill the valleys on all but the southern and western flanks. Some climbing routes are relatively straightforward hikes to the top, but this is the very reason that Aconcagua has one of the highest mountain death tolls in the world: It is a popular mountain, and many of its climbers tend to move too swiftly up the mountain, with little respect for the elevation or the weather, which on Aconcagua can quickly become severe."

  Since the first ascent in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, reaching the summit of Everest has been considered one of the greatest achievements in mountaineering.\n
  Every spring, Alpine Ascents International embraces this challenge, taking a group of qualified climbers to climb Mt. Everest via the South Col route in Nepal.\n
  With over 25 years of guiding experience on Everest, Alpine Ascents is recognized as the premier guide service to provide you a truly rewarding experience climbing to the summit of the highest mountain in the world. We are known for the quality of our logistical services and the expertise of our guides, Sherpa team, and Base Camp staff. We have the latest technology in weather forecasting and communication systems both on and off the mountain. Our Base Camp services, which provide private tents and well-prepared meals by western trained chefs allow you to relax and regain strength when returning from your acclimation climbs.\n
  On the mountain, our guides and Sherpa are focused on your welfare and safety.\n
  Our philosophy is that by working together as a team we will climb safer and have more climbers reach the summit.\n

  "EVEREST CANCELLATION/REFUND POLICY\n\n

  Refund Policy: No refunds are provided on the deposit or any payments for the expedition. The reason for such a strict refund policy is due to the great expense incurred in such an expedition. All gear and food must be purchased several months in advance to ensure that it reaches Nepal and Base Camp before we arrive. Our refund policy also protects other members who have committed their time and money to the expedition.\n
  Each deposit and remaining balance is nonrefundable.\n
  All balances are due 120 days prior to departure date unless otherwise specified.\n
  Emergency: In case of emergency and at any time during the expedition, Alpine Ascents and its staff will use all resources available to rescue and evacuate injured climbers. From Base Camp, helicopter rescue is possible. Above Base Camp, an emergency situation can only be handled with the resources of the expedition and other expeditions in the area.\n
  Any additional cost involved in an emergency will be the responsibility of the climbing member(s) requiring immediate medical attention and/or evacuation.\n


  TRIP CANCELLATION INSURANCE\n\n

  As there are many unforeseen circumstances that may occur during or leading up to the trip, we highly recommend trip cancellation insurance.\n
  In many situations, this may be the only way to receive a refund for unused services.\n
  In brief, trip cancellation insurance may allow you to get reimbursement if you need to cancel your expedition when you are not entitled to a refund from Alpine Ascents.\n

  description: "Himalayan Experience has traditionally been working on the Tibet (North) side of Everest. However, due to the unreliability of access, we have decided to operate from the Nepal (South) side.
  Russell Brice, the founder of Himalayan Experience, first climbed on the West Ridge from the Western Cwm in 1981. Although this expedition is relatively new to our clients, Himalayan Experience is very familiar with this route. All of our Sherpa Staff come from the Khumbu region, just a few days walk from Base Camp.",

  title: "Everest South Side Climb Nepal  ‚Ä¢  29,035'  ‚Ä¢  8850m",
  description: "We‚Äôve been organizing Everest expeditions for over 35 years, and each
year do our best to put together a strong team with compatible climbers
and top notch western and sherpa guides and leaders. Since 2009 Eric
has been ably assisted by IMG‚Äôs Greg Vernovage. We fill our trips, and
thus can be picky; we‚Äôve turned away many climbers whom we feel will
not be a good fit with our program.
IMG has long been a leader in innovative climbing programs to the
Himalayas. We were one of the very first companies to offer guided
programs to Everest (1991), the first company to offer a stand-alone
climb to the North Col (1994) and to 8000m (2001). We were one of
the first companies to guide Shishapangma (1990) and Cho Oyu
(1995), first to guide Khumbu Icefall as a stand-alone program (2000),
first to offer the option of personal sherpa guides to climbers (2002),
first successfully guided climb of Lhotse (2009), first with the Hybrid
concept (2010), first to offer an Everest ‚ÄúExpress‚Äù itinerary (2010), and
the first to rappel an alternate route around the Hillary Step (2013).
With over 600 summits of 8000 meter peaks to our IMG credit, and 482
of them on Mount Everest, we are still never satisfied and continue to
look for ways to improve our IMG Everest program. For 2018 we
continue our tradition of innovation and attention to the details. We put
in place first class logistics and staffing. We don‚Äôt cut corners. Our
goal is to conduct the very best program that we can, at a fair price.
We don‚Äôt think you will be disappointed.",
  gearlist: "Travel Items
- Duffel Bags: One duffle will accompany you on the trek to BC. Climbers will need a second duffel,
which will be packed with the mountain equipment and which will go direct to BC. Duffels are carried
by porters and yaks and should be sturdy and waterproof with name written on bag (in case tag is
lost). Bags with wheels are nice for the airport, but the porters and yaks don‚Äôt like to carry them, so
don‚Äôt bring wheeled bags. You will also store some travel clothes at the hotel in Kathmandu while
trekking, so a smaller additional bag with a lock might be handy. Tip: Bring 5 large plastic garbage
bags to pack gear inside duffels to protect gear from rain.
- Daypack: Large daypack or bag with a shoulder strap, so you don‚Äôt have to set it down while doing
the duffle shuffle or handling travel documents while going through passport control and customs at
the airport. It needs to be big enough to hold everything you‚Äôll need for an overnight stop.
- Locks: You‚Äôll want padlocks in Nepal and Tibet, but for flying out of the USA, it might be better to use
plastic zip ties which can be cut by TSA staff if necessary (bring extra zip ties).
- Travel Wallet: Important for carrying your important documents including passport, extra photos,
duffel inventory list, and money. We suggest that you use a travel wallet that you can hang around
your neck and place inside your shirt, or around your waist tucked under your shirt or trousers.
- Passport (valid for at least 6 months after the trip ends with sufficient extra pages for visa stamps and
in same name as airline ticket (or with endorsement-for women who changed name w/ marriage).
Get your Nepal visa on arrival in Kathmandu at the airport ($40 for trekkers, $100 for climbers).
- Additional passport photos: one for Nepal visa (needed on arrival at KTM airport). If you plan on
buying a local sim card for your unlocked cell phone you will need one (also a copy of your passport).
- Photocopy of passport and photocopy of flight itinerary
- Bathing Suit: Some of the hotels have pools (eg, in Bangkok).

Trekking Gear
- Trekking Poles: Get collapsible poles that can attach to your backpack.
- Backpacks: The ‚Äúday pack‚Äù is great for a travel carry-on and may be big enough for the trek (need
room for your clothes, water, camera, food, etc during the day while hiking). Climbers will need a
larger pack (60 liter size is popular) and this will also be fine for the trek. For the international flights
put your backpack into the duffle bags, but carry it on the plane for the Lukla flight.
- Pack Cover: Waterproof rain cover for your pack.
- Sleeping Bag: Rated to at least 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Synthetic or Down. Base Camp can get down
to around 0-10 degrees F at night‚Ä¶so quite chilly. Everest and Lhotse climbers will want to bring a
second sleeping bag (available for rent if you do not have a suitable one).
- Trekkers do not need a pad (foam mattress provided for trek and Base Camp). Climbers should have
a Thermarest, NeoAir, or similar lightweight pad to augment the closed cell pads in higher camps.

Footwear
- Lightweight Shoes: Running/tennis shoes and sandals for camp, around town, etc.
- Hiking Boots: Medium-weight hiking boots, waterproofed and broken-in
- Gaiters: To keep snow, mud, and scree out of your hiking boots while trekking to Base Camp.
- Socks: at least 5 complete changes of socks, in a combination that you have used and know works
for you. Make sure your boots are roomy enough for the sock combination you intend to use. Tight
boots will make your feet cold. It is no problem to wash underwear, socks, etc at Base Camp!
- For trekkers on the Gokyo departure option (crossing high passes) we suggest bringing Kahtoola
Microspikes or similar traction devices in case of slippery trail conditions.

  Clothing
- Base Layer: 2 pair synthetic long johns: one midweight set and one expedition weight set.
- Mid Layers: One additional warm layer (wool sweater, fleece jacket, shelled vest, light puffy, etc).
- Shell Jacket: Waterproof/breathable jacket with hood.
- Shell Pants: Waterproof/breathable pants (full side zips are best).
- Climbing/Trekking Pants: Look for construction that provides freedom of movement and/or stretch
materials. Fabric should be a breathable synthetic that preferably holds up to abrasion and dries
quickly. You can wear them over longjohns if it is cold.
- Warm Parka: Down or synthetic. This should be big enough to go over other garments. Many
climbers and trekkers also like insulated pants for cold mornings and evenings.
- Trekking Clothes: Light hiking pants and / or hiking shorts for warm weather down low- NOT cotton.
Shirts for hiking on nice days (t-shirts OK, quick-drying synthetic fabric far better.)
- Casual Clothes: For travel/meals in hotels. You‚Äôll want a shirt or two with a collar to wear on flights
and for restaurants. A sweatshirt or light jacket might be nice in the evening.
- Gloves: Light gloves for hiking and warm ski gloves. Bring mittens too if your hands tend to get cold.
- Hats: Warm wool or heavy fleece hat, sun hat and bandana.
- A ‚ÄúBuff‚Äù or light balaclava to breathe through in the cold dry air. Good for preventing ‚ÄúKhumbu cough‚Äù

Personal Accessories
- Water Bottles: 2 water bottles with foam insulation shells. Bring a Pee bottle too.
- Water Treatment: Iodine tablets (Potable Aqua or similar) or iodine crystals (Polar Pure) are easy and
inexpensive. Many people also like to use the ‚ÄúSteri Pen‚Äù or similar devices. Filters can freeze.
- Hand sanitizer (Purell), ear plugs, and several rolls of toilet paper (we will have a supply at Base
Camp), small towel, soap/shampoo, a few disposable dust masks, hand cream (for chapped hands).
- Headlamp. Climbers should bring a second ‚Äúback up‚Äù headlamp. For high altitude we recommend use
of lithium AA batteries (beware of headlamps which do not accept lithium batteries).
- Camera: With spare batteries and memory cards (also for swapping photos).
- Pocket Knife (climbers need a small sharp knife that is accessible if you really need it).
- Wrist Watch: With alarm and light for reading in the dark. We like the Suunto altimeter ones.
- Eyewear: Bring good sunglasses. For contact lens wearers, ski goggles with light color lenses (for
use at night) might be useful in windy conditions that cause blowing dust.
- Vision correction: Bring extra prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses if you wear them. Lens
solutions are not widely available in Nepal, bring enough.
- Skin Care: Maximum SPF sunscreen and lip balm.
- Basic First Aid: you‚Äôll want moleskin, tape, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin (many climbers take
81mg every day to prevent stroke), Imodium and Pepto Bismol for diarrhea, Band-Aids, antacid.
- Prescription Medications: 1) Antibiotic for upper respiratory problems (azithromycin) 2) Antibiotic for
GI problems (Cipro or azithromycin); 3) Diamox (acetazolamide) for acclimatization (125 mg tabs
recommended, enough for a week); 4) Sleeping pills for jet lag; 5) Tylenol 3 or similar for coughing; 6)
Malaria Chemoprophylaxis, if needed based on travel plans; 7) Asthma medication, if any history
(many climbers use Advair inhalers at high altitude to prevent Khumbu cough); 8) nifedipine (for
pulmonary edema); and 9) dexamethasome (for cerebral edema).
- Cold medicine (Sudafed, etc), Chloroseptic or Tessalon Perles throat lozenges.
- Personal Snack Food: Approximately 10 pounds of personal snacks (for Everest climbers) or 5
pounds (for EBC Trekkers and Lobuche climbers). Also, some drink mixes if you like these (add drink
mix to your water bottle after giving iodine tablets 30 minutes of contact time). Everest climbers
should really focus on bringing snacks you know you will be able to tolerate up high!
- Books/ Ipods/ Kindle. Plan on sharing among your team members. You can also borrow from and add
to the Base Camp Library we establish every year.",

  title: "Everest South Side Climb Nepal  ‚Ä¢  29,035'  ‚Ä¢  8850m",
  description: "We‚Äôve been organizing Everest expeditions for over 35 years, and each
year do our best to put together a strong team with compatible climbers
and top notch western and sherpa guides and leaders. Since 2009 Eric
has been ably assisted by IMG‚Äôs Greg Vernovage. We fill our trips, and
thus can be picky; we‚Äôve turned away many climbers whom we feel will
not be a good fit with our program.
IMG has long been a leader in innovative climbing programs to the
Himalayas. We were one of the very first companies to offer guided
programs to Everest (1991), the first company to offer a stand-alone
climb to the North Col (1994) and to 8000m (2001). We were one of
the first companies to guide Shishapangma (1990) and Cho Oyu
(1995), first to guide Khumbu Icefall as a stand-alone program (2000),
first to offer the option of personal sherpa guides to climbers (2002),
first successfully guided climb of Lhotse (2009), first with the Hybrid
concept (2010), first to offer an Everest ‚ÄúExpress‚Äù itinerary (2010), and
the first to rappel an alternate route around the Hillary Step (2013).
With over 600 summits of 8000 meter peaks to our IMG credit, and 482
of them on Mount Everest, we are still never satisfied and continue to
look for ways to improve our IMG Everest program. For 2018 we
continue our tradition of innovation and attention to the details. We put
in place first class logistics and staffing. We don‚Äôt cut corners. Our
goal is to conduct the very best program that we can, at a fair price.
We don‚Äôt think you will be disappointed.",
  gearlist: "Travel Items
- Duffel Bags: One duffle will accompany you on the trek to BC. Climbers will need a second duffel,
which will be packed with the mountain equipment and which will go direct to BC. Duffels are carried
by porters and yaks and should be sturdy and waterproof with name written on bag (in case tag is
lost). Bags with wheels are nice for the airport, but the porters and yaks don‚Äôt like to carry them, so
don‚Äôt bring wheeled bags. You will also store some travel clothes at the hotel in Kathmandu while
trekking, so a smaller additional bag with a lock might be handy. Tip: Bring 5 large plastic garbage
bags to pack gear inside duffels to protect gear from rain.
- Daypack: Large daypack or bag with a shoulder strap, so you don‚Äôt have to set it down while doing
the duffle shuffle or handling travel documents while going through passport control and customs at
the airport. It needs to be big enough to hold everything you‚Äôll need for an overnight stop.
- Locks: You‚Äôll want padlocks in Nepal and Tibet, but for flying out of the USA, it might be better to use
plastic zip ties which can be cut by TSA staff if necessary (bring extra zip ties).
- Travel Wallet: Important for carrying your important documents including passport, extra photos,
duffel inventory list, and money. We suggest that you use a travel wallet that you can hang around
your neck and place inside your shirt, or around your waist tucked under your shirt or trousers.
- Passport (valid for at least 6 months after the trip ends with sufficient extra pages for visa stamps and
in same name as airline ticket (or with endorsement-for women who changed name w/ marriage).
Get your Nepal visa on arrival in Kathmandu at the airport ($40 for trekkers, $100 for climbers).
- Additional passport photos: one for Nepal visa (needed on arrival at KTM airport). If you plan on
buying a local sim card for your unlocked cell phone you will need one (also a copy of your passport).
- Photocopy of passport and photocopy of flight itinerary
- Bathing Suit: Some of the hotels have pools (eg, in Bangkok).

Trekking Gear
- Trekking Poles: Get collapsible poles that can attach to your backpack.
- Backpacks: The ‚Äúday pack‚Äù is great for a travel carry-on and may be big enough for the trek (need
room for your clothes, water, camera, food, etc during the day while hiking). Climbers will need a
larger pack (60 liter size is popular) and this will also be fine for the trek. For the international flights
put your backpack into the duffle bags, but carry it on the plane for the Lukla flight.
- Pack Cover: Waterproof rain cover for your pack.
- Sleeping Bag: Rated to at least 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Synthetic or Down. Base Camp can get down
to around 0-10 degrees F at night‚Ä¶so quite chilly. Everest and Lhotse climbers will want to bring a
second sleeping bag (available for rent if you do not have a suitable one).
- Trekkers do not need a pad (foam mattress provided for trek and Base Camp). Climbers should have
a Thermarest, NeoAir, or similar lightweight pad to augment the closed cell pads in higher camps.

Footwear
- Lightweight Shoes: Running/tennis shoes and sandals for camp, around town, etc.
- Hiking Boots: Medium-weight hiking boots, waterproofed and broken-in
- Gaiters: To keep snow, mud, and scree out of your hiking boots while trekking to Base Camp.
- Socks: at least 5 complete changes of socks, in a combination that you have used and know works
for you. Make sure your boots are roomy enough for the sock combination you intend to use. Tight
boots will make your feet cold. It is no problem to wash underwear, socks, etc at Base Camp!
- For trekkers on the Gokyo departure option (crossing high passes) we suggest bringing Kahtoola
Microspikes or similar traction devices in case of slippery trail conditions.

  Clothing
- Base Layer: 2 pair synthetic long johns: one midweight set and one expedition weight set.
- Mid Layers: One additional warm layer (wool sweater, fleece jacket, shelled vest, light puffy, etc).
- Shell Jacket: Waterproof/breathable jacket with hood.
- Shell Pants: Waterproof/breathable pants (full side zips are best).
- Climbing/Trekking Pants: Look for construction that provides freedom of movement and/or stretch
materials. Fabric should be a breathable synthetic that preferably holds up to abrasion and dries
quickly. You can wear them over longjohns if it is cold.
- Warm Parka: Down or synthetic. This should be big enough to go over other garments. Many
climbers and trekkers also like insulated pants for cold mornings and evenings.
- Trekking Clothes: Light hiking pants and / or hiking shorts for warm weather down low- NOT cotton.
Shirts for hiking on nice days (t-shirts OK, quick-drying synthetic fabric far better.)
- Casual Clothes: For travel/meals in hotels. You‚Äôll want a shirt or two with a collar to wear on flights
and for restaurants. A sweatshirt or light jacket might be nice in the evening.
- Gloves: Light gloves for hiking and warm ski gloves. Bring mittens too if your hands tend to get cold.
- Hats: Warm wool or heavy fleece hat, sun hat and bandana.
- A ‚ÄúBuff‚Äù or light balaclava to breathe through in the cold dry air. Good for preventing ‚ÄúKhumbu cough‚Äù

Personal Accessories
- Water Bottles: 2 water bottles with foam insulation shells. Bring a Pee bottle too.
- Water Treatment: Iodine tablets (Potable Aqua or similar) or iodine crystals (Polar Pure) are easy and
inexpensive. Many people also like to use the ‚ÄúSteri Pen‚Äù or similar devices. Filters can freeze.
- Hand sanitizer (Purell), ear plugs, and several rolls of toilet paper (we will have a supply at Base
Camp), small towel, soap/shampoo, a few disposable dust masks, hand cream (for chapped hands).
- Headlamp. Climbers should bring a second ‚Äúback up‚Äù headlamp. For high altitude we recommend use
of lithium AA batteries (beware of headlamps which do not accept lithium batteries).
- Camera: With spare batteries and memory cards (also for swapping photos).
- Pocket Knife (climbers need a small sharp knife that is accessible if you really need it).
- Wrist Watch: With alarm and light for reading in the dark. We like the Suunto altimeter ones.
- Eyewear: Bring good sunglasses. For contact lens wearers, ski goggles with light color lenses (for
use at night) might be useful in windy conditions that cause blowing dust.
- Vision correction: Bring extra prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses if you wear them. Lens
solutions are not widely available in Nepal, bring enough.
- Skin Care: Maximum SPF sunscreen and lip balm.
- Basic First Aid: you‚Äôll want moleskin, tape, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin (many climbers take
81mg every day to prevent stroke), Imodium and Pepto Bismol for diarrhea, Band-Aids, antacid.
- Prescription Medications: 1) Antibiotic for upper respiratory problems (azithromycin) 2) Antibiotic for
GI problems (Cipro or azithromycin); 3) Diamox (acetazolamide) for acclimatization (125 mg tabs
recommended, enough for a week); 4) Sleeping pills for jet lag; 5) Tylenol 3 or similar for coughing; 6)
Malaria Chemoprophylaxis, if needed based on travel plans; 7) Asthma medication, if any history
(many climbers use Advair inhalers at high altitude to prevent Khumbu cough); 8) nifedipine (for
pulmonary edema); and 9) dexamethasome (for cerebral edema).
- Cold medicine (Sudafed, etc), Chloroseptic or Tessalon Perles throat lozenges.
- Personal Snack Food: Approximately 10 pounds of personal snacks (for Everest climbers) or 5
pounds (for EBC Trekkers and Lobuche climbers). Also, some drink mixes if you like these (add drink
mix to your water bottle after giving iodine tablets 30 minutes of contact time). Everest climbers
should really focus on bringing snacks you know you will be able to tolerate up high!
- Books/ Ipods/ Kindle. Plan on sharing among your team members. You can also borrow from and add
to the Base Camp Library we establish every year.",

  title: "Everest Base Camp Trek",
  description:"One of the most famous treks in the world takes you deep into the heart of the Nepalese Himalaya. You'll trek four to five hours a day surrounded by many of the world's highest and most beautiful mountains. Along the way there's a chance to soak up local food and culture and you'll sleep in traditional, warm and friendly tea houses run by Sherpa families.
  Jagged Globe offer two variations of this classic trek, see also Everest 3 Peaks 3 Passes. Both treks take you all the way to Base Camp itself, which sprawls out below the dramatic tumbling Khumbu Icefall, and include climbing to the famous Everest viewing point of Kala Patthar (5,600m). As well as Everest, you'll meet its impressive neighbours: Lhotse, Nuptse and Ama Dablam.
The adventure begins in Kathmandu, where you can explore and relax for a night before flying to Lukla. The mountain airstrip here is the gateway to Nepal's famous Khumbu region. You'll set off for your first night on the trail straight away, criss-crossing the Dudh Kosi river on airy suspension bridges as you make your way towards Everest.
The journey takes you through many Sherpa villages, including the childhood home of the famous mountaineer, Tenzing Norgay. Namche Bazaar is another highlight. Many Tibetans cross the nearby border to trade traditional artefacts at the market in this prosperous town. Then there's the monastery at Thyangboche, bird-filled rhododendron bushes and sunset views of Everest.
Our Everest Base Camp trek is at least a day longer than most you'll find. At Jagged Globe we want to ensure teams get the fullest experience possible and acclimatise properly, so there's the best chance of a successful and enjoyable ascent. Widely considered one of the world's foremost organisations running expeditions to Everest's summit, we are just as proud to offer what we think is the best trek available to Base Camp.
Our Everest Base Camp is at least one day longer than most treks, giving you more time to acclimatise
There is an option for a 2-week trip, flying by helicopter from Lobuje to Lukla on return, thus saving 4 days
We have been leading expeditions to the summit of Everest since 1993. In the spring season, you can meet our climbing team
You stay in comfortable lodges (or Tea Houses) rather than camping
We take special care of our porters. They are probably the best equipped and clothed in Nepal
You can take advantage of our comprehensive equipment hire service
Your kit bag is carried for you, so you only need carry a day pack
Prices include all permits

  title: "Mt. Everest Southside",
  description: "Mt. Everest. The tallest mountain in the world soars almost five and a half miles into the sky and pierces the jet stream with its iconic summit.
   Embarking on an expedition to Mt. Everest can be the pinnacle of a climbing career and deserves all of the personal support and guidance that RMI offers.

   EXPEDITION HIGHLIGHTS

Join a small and personal climbing team with a 3:1 climber to guide ratio and a 1:1 climber to Sherpa ratio.
Enjoy the best Base Camp facilities available.
Take comfort in the comprehensive medical support available through our unlimited access to Everest's Base Camp clinic and highly trained guides.
Navigate the Khumbu Icefall, cross the Yellow Band, and ascend the Hillary Step with the guidance and partnership of RMI's experienced Everest guides.
Take part in an RMI Everest Expedition and see why we continue to set the standard in guiding excellence.

RMI's small, exclusive team is led by tenured RMI Guide and Everest veterans. RMI's guiding approach on Everest differs notably from many other guide services as we intentionally keep our team small. Instead of running a large expedition with many climbers, we focus our attention on leading a more personal climbing team, concentrating our resources on each individual to ensure the safest, most enjoyable, and most successful experience possible for each one of our climbers. RMI's Everest Expedition has one of the best climber-to-guide ratios on the mountain. This lower ratio provides our climbers with many benefits including:

Providing the flexibility to tailor climbing agendas and acclimatization schedules to individual needs.
Giving climbers consistent guidance from our experienced western guides throughout the climb.
Allowing our climbers to build solid rapports with their guides and fellow team members; we share our meals around one table, discuss route and weather conditions together, and plan and approach the climb as a close-knit team.
Superior Sherpa support.
Having a smaller team facilitates stronger team dynamics, better communication, individualized attention, helps avoid the fragmentation inherent to larger expeditions, and we believe creates the strongest and most enjoyable climbing team possible.

With over four decades of mountain guiding experience RMI has rightfully earned our standing as one of the most distinguished guide services in the world: we maintain strict standards of safety, climb with small ratios, offer an unparalleled level of service, provide you with the best, most experienced Mt. Everest guides, and have an infrastructure that is entirely geared toward your individual safety and success on Mt. Everest.",



  gearlist:
  "PACK & BAG
  2 DUFFEL BAG(S)
A 120+ liter bag made of tough material with rugged zippers.

  2 SMALL DUFFEL(S)
An 80 - 90 liter bag. One duffel bag will be used for your second checked bag for the flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. The second bag is needed to store gear in Kathmandu.

BACKPACK
A 50 - 55 liter pack is the recommended size for this climb. A separate summit pack is not needed.

PACK COVER (OPTIONAL)
Protects your pack from rain while on the trail.

DAY PACK
A 25+ liter day pack to use as carry-on, while traveling or sightseeing.

SLEEPING BAG
A bag rated -20¬∞ F will keep you warm. If you would prefer NOT to share group bags at the higher camps, you should bring a second bag rated -20¬∞ F or lower.

COMPRESSION STUFF SACK FOR SLEEPING BAG

SLEEPING PAD
Full-length inflatable or closed cell pad.

SLEEPING PAD - INFLATABLE
A full-length inflatable pad.

TECHNICAL GEAR
ICE AXE
The length of your axe depends on your height. Use the following general mountaineering formula: up to 5'8, use a 65 cm axe; 5'8 to 6'2, use a 70 cm axe; and taller, use a 75 cm axe. If you hold the axe so that it hangs comfortably at your side, the spike of the axe should still be a few inches above the ground.

ICE AXE HOLSTER

CLIMBING HARNESS
We recommend a comfortable, adjustable alpine climbing harness. Removable, drop seat or adjustable leg loops are convenient for managing your clothing layers over the course of the climb and facilitate going to the bathroom.

1 TRIPLE-ACTION LOCKING CARABINER(S)
Used for clipping into the climbing rope.

2 LOCKING CARABINER(S)
Used for clipping into anchors, etc.

3 NON-LOCKING CARABINER(S)
Used for pack ditch loop, etc.

HELMET
A UIAA (Union Internationale des Associations d‚ÄôAlpinisme) or CE (European Committee for Standardization) certified climbing helmet. Bicycle or ski helmets are designed for a different type of impact and will not substitute as a climbing helmet.

CRAMPONS
The 12-point adjustable crampons designed for general mountaineering are ideal. We highly recommend anti-bot plates to prevent snow from balling up underfoot.

AVALANCHE TRANSCEIVER
A digital transceiver is preferred; analog will work as well. If you rent a transceiver, one set of new batteries will be provided.

TREKKING POLES
Lightweight and collapsible poles are preferred. Larger baskets work well with deep snow. Ski poles will also work.

MECHANICAL ASCENDER
For traveling on fixed ropes. Most people prefer an ascender designed for their weak hand, leaving their strong hand free to hold their ice axe. For example, a right-handed person would use a left-handed ascender.

BELAY / RAPPEL DEVICE
A plate-style belay/rappel device, ensure that it can handle rope sizes 6 to 13 mm.

60 cm sewn sling (single-length runner).

15 ' PERLON CORD
6 mm cordelette in one continuous length.

HEAD
2 WARM HATS
Wool or synthetic hats; one light and one heavy.

BUFF / NECK GAITER / BALACLAVA
One item for face protection is required. Our primary recommendation is the Buff. A neck gaiter or balaclava is also acceptable.

BALL CAP OR SUN HAT

GLACIER GLASSES
You will need protective sunglasses, either dark-lensed with side shields or full wrap-around frames. Almost all sunglasses block UV-A, UV-B and infrared rays adequately. Pay attention to the visible light transmission. The darkest lenses (glacier glasses) only allow approx. 6% visible light to get through, while lighter lenses (driving glasses) let in as much as 20+ %. A good rule of thumb is that if you can see the wearer‚Äôs pupils through the lenses, they are too light for sun protection at altitude.

GOGGLES
Amber or rose-tinted goggles for adverse weather. On windy days, climbers, especially contact lens wearers, may find photochromatic lenses the most versatile in a variety of light conditions.

CONTACT LENSES/ EYEGLASSES
Spare prescription glasses if you wear contact lenses/eyeglasses.

2 HEADLAMPS
Bring two headlamps for the Expedition. The second is for use around camp and to serve as a backup. Be sure to begin the program with fresh batteries.

  HANDS
  LIGHT WEIGHT GLOVE
One pair of fleece, soft-shell or wind-stopper gloves.

1 - 2 MEDIUM WEIGHT GLOVE(S)
Wind/water resistant, insulated mountain gloves.

HEAVY WEIGHT INSULATED GLOVE OR MITTEN
Wind/water resistant, insulated gloves or mittens. These also serve as emergency back-ups if you drop or lose a glove.

2 WORK GLOVES
Medium weight insulated gloves for climbing and working around camp. These should be both durable and dexterous enough to allow you to perform activities like setting up or taking down tents while wearing them.

UPPER BODY: We recommend a minimum of five upper body layers, all of which can be used in conjunction with each other. Two of these should be insulating layers, one light and one medium, that fit well together. Today there are many different layering systems to choose from, including fleece, soft-shell, down and synthetic options.
2 - 3 LIGHT TO MEDIUM WEIGHT BASELAYER
Long-sleeve wool or synthetic top. Quarter zip styles will allow for better temperature regulation. We recommend light colors, which best reflect the intense sun on hot days.

INSULATING LAYER - LIGHTWEIGHT

INSULATING LAYER - MEDIUM WEIGHT

RAIN JACKET (HARD SHELL)
A jacket made of rain-proof material with an attached hood.  We recommend a thinner lightweight jacket rather than a heavier insulated jacket.

DOWN PARKA WITH ATTACHED HOOD
This item becomes of highest importance when we are faced with poor weather. This should be an expedition-style parka. The parka is worn primarily in camp, at rest breaks, and on summit day (when it is of crucial importance). When sizing a parka, allow for several layers to be worn underneath; buy it large. The parka must have an insulated hood.

3 - 4 HIKING SHIRT
Lightweight, synthetic shirt with either long or short sleeves. Long sleeves and hoods are preferred for sun/bug protection.

DOWN SUIT
An 8,000 meter down suit.

SPORTS BRA
We recommend a moisture-wicking, active-wear bra.

LOWER BODY: We recommend a system of four layers, all of which can be used in conjunction with each other. Products which combine several layers into one garment, such as traditional ski pants, don‚Äôt work well as they don‚Äôt offer the versatility of a layering system.
4 - 8 PAIR UNDERWEAR
Non-cotton briefs or boxers.

2 - 3 PAIR LIGHT TO MEDIUM WEIGHT BASELAYER
Synthetic or wool.

CLIMBING PANT
Soft-shell climbing pants offer a wide range of versatility. You can wear them in combination with the base layer on colder days, or alone on warmer days.

RAIN PANT (HARD SHELL)
A waterproof pant with 3/4 side zippers (sometimes called 7/8 or full side zips) are required for facilitating quick clothing adjustments over boots and crampons.

DOWN OR SYNTHETIC INSULATED PANT (OPTIONAL)
A synthetic primaloft pant.

LIGHT WEIGHT TREKKING PANT
A lightweight, synthetic pair of pants is a good option for the approach trek when hiking at lower altitudes and in warm conditions. These pants have no insulation, are typically made of thin nylon, and commonly feature zippers to convert between pants and shorts.

CASUAL CAMP PANT
A pair of jeans or cotton pants. Great for wearing around camp or teahouses.

FEET
MOUNTAINEERING BOOTS
The function of footwear is of crucial importance. Select a brand's -top of the line- model and it should be sufficient. The boot needs to be roomy enough to allow for good circulation. Anticipate a sock combination when sizing them (single sock, liner and sock, or two heavy socks on each foot). Wear the boots as often as possible before the climb, to determine proper fit, comfort and performance.

OVERBOOTS
These are not necessary with all-in-one boot / gaiter models. Expedition overboots add significant warmth, especially at high altitude and need to be compatible with the style of crampons used.

HIKING BOOTS
A pair of lightweight boots for approaches and hiking on rugged terrain.

4 - 8 PAIR SOCKS
Either wool or synthetic. Whatever sock combination you are accustomed to wearing during your training or previous adventures (whether single medium weight socks, a medium weight with a liner sock, two medium weight socks together, etc.), should work just fine for this climb.

GAITERS
A knee-length pair of gaiters, large enough to fit over your mountaineering boots, will be needed for protection from snow, mud, and catching your crampons on loose clothing. These are not necessary with all-in-one boot / gaiter models.

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
SUNSCREEN
We recommend small tubes of SPF 15 or higher, which can be carried in pockets for easy access and to prevent freezing.

LIP BALM
We recommend SPF 15 or higher.

MEALS
See the Food tab for suggestions and quantities.
10 - 12 CHEMICAL HAND WARMERS

2 WATER BOTTLES
Hard-sided, screw-top, one-liter water bottles with wide mouths are required. Plastics made with high post-consumer recycled content and BPA-Free are recommended.

2 INSULATED WATER BOTTLE COVERS
These help prevent freezing. It should completely cover the bottle.

AQUAMIRA WATER TREATMENT DROPS
Chlorine Dioxide water purification drops. We do not recommend the tablets.

  5 GARBAGE BAGS (LARGE)
We recommend lining your backpack with garbage bags to keep items in your backpack completely dry.

2 SETS ALKALINE BATTERIES
For avalanche transceiver.

LUGGAGE LOCKS
For your duffel bags. Must be TSA approved.

Rainier Mountaineering, Inc. reserves the right to modify the land cost of a trip at any time before departure.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Managing risk is RMI's number one priority. Our guides manage significant hazards inherent in mountaineering such as avalanches, ice fall, rock fall, inclement weather, and high winds, but they cannot eliminate them.

Please clearly understand that mountaineering is inherently a hazardous sport. You are choosing to engage in an activity in which participants have been injured and killed. While those accidents are indeed infrequent, they may occur at any time and be out of our control. We ask that participants acknowledge the risk and hazards of mountaineering, and make their own choices about whether or not to engage in this activity.

CLIMBER RESPONSIBILITIES
Mountaineering is both an individual challenge and a team endeavor. Some of the responsibility for the team is carried by the individual climbers. For this reason, we ask that each participant:

is physically and mentally fit, properly attired and equipped, and continues to self assess throughout the program to ensure as safe a climb as possible. If a climber‚Äôs own physical fitness limits his or her ability to safely continue upward, that can have a negative impact on the summit experience or opportunity of other climb participants.
honestly and accurately describe themselves, in terms of fitness, health and skills, and their equipment to their guides, and that they adhere to the advice of their professional mountain guide.
AGE-APPROPRIATE GUIDELINES & RESTRICTIONS
In the interest of the safety and well-being of all participants, RMI adheres to the following age-appropriate guidelines:

Ages 15 & under: No participants age 15 & under
Ages 16 & 17: Accompanied by parent or legal guardian
Ages 18 & above: No restrictions
An individual‚Äôs birthday must precede the departure date of the program. For example: a 15 year old who turns 16 on July 1 may participate on a program beginning July 2.

Under-aged participants on Private Climb or Group Climb programs are assessed on an individual basis.

A minor climber must be accompanied by their parent/legal guardian throughout the entirety of the program. If either climber must descend at any time during the program, both climbers must descend together.

SUMMIT ATTEMPT
RMI cannot guarantee that you will reach the summit. Weather, route conditions, your own abilities, or the abilities of other climbers may create circumstances that make an ascent unsafe, and you or your entire party may have to turn around without reaching the summit. Failure to reach the summit due to a person‚Äôs own lack of fitness or to any of the events associated with mountaineering (such as weather, route, avalanche hazard, team dynamics, etc.), are not Rainier Mountaineering, Inc.‚Äôs responsibility and will not result in refund or reschedule.

GENERAL POLICIES
Any Participant under the age of 18 must be accompanied on the trip by a parent or legal guardian and both the Participant and parent or legal guardian must sign all forms.

RMI's program schedule and itineraries are subject to change or adjustment based on a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to, route conditions, weather, terrain, currency fluctuations, changes in outfitting costs, government instability, and many other factors. RMI has complete discretion to change plans to accommodate any of these or other factors, including but not limited to increases in program fees, changes to program schedule or itinerary, and changes to guides or staff, as necessary for the proper and safe conduct of the program.

We reserve the right to cancel any program due to inadequate signups, weather or route conditions. In such a case, a full refund is given; however, RMI cannot be responsible for any additional expenses incurred in preparing for the program (i.e., airline tickets, equipment purchase or rental, hotel reservations).

If the Participant decides to leave a trip at any time after the start of the trip and prior to its conclusion, he or she will not be entitled to a refund.

RMI reserves the right to dismiss the Participant from a trip or to send the Participant to a lower altitude at any time if RMI determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant is not physically, technically, or psychologically prepared for or capable of participating in the program.

The Participant understands and agrees that RMI assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any travel and hospitality service provided to the Participant by others in connection with the trip, including but not limited to the services provided by airlines, hotels, and motor vehicle operators, and that RMI is not responsible for any act, error, omission, or any injury, loss, accident, delay, irregularity, or danger by a supplier of travel or hospitality services to the Participant in connection with the RMI program.

RMI recommends and strongly advises that the Participant have or purchase personal life, medical, accident, travel, baggage, trip cancellation, and other insurance that may pertain to participation in the program. The Participant understands that RMI provides no such insurance coverage in connection with the trip.",

Experience the unique culture, environment, and people of Tibet. Climb Everest in half of the time of traditional expeditions, with the North Side's most professional team and best logistics.",
  gearlist:
  "Your favorite Baseball Hat
Hat - Bring your favorite baseball hat for shelter from the sun. No
white under the brim - the reflection off of it from the sun is blinding.

Alpenglow Expeditions Neck Gaiter
Neck Gaiter (Buff) - A multi purpose neck gator that can also be
worn under your hat. Make sure that it covers as much skin as
possible and yet is still comfy. We also recommend the Eddie Bauer
Multiclava and the Original Buff.

Patagonia Balaclava
Balaclava - We recommend a tight-fitting balaclava that is worn
under your hat. Make sure that it covers as much skin as possible,
but is comfortable enough to wear for hours.

Eddie Bauer Telemetry
Beanie - A comfortable, warm well-fitting hat that covers your ears.
Make sure that one of your hats fits under a helmet. We also
recommend the Patagonia Lined Beanie.

Black Diamond Vapor
Climbing Helmet - Easily adjustable lightweight helmet that fits with
hat and Balaclava. Make sure this is a climbing-specific helmet.

Kaenon Klay
Glacier Glasses (2 pairs) - Must have dark lenses. Minimal light
should come in below, above, or around the sides of the

Make sure you are getting a snug fit with lenses for bright sun.
Ventilation and anti-fog features are recommended. Julbo Universe
Goggles also recommended.

Black Diamond Powerweight Liner Glove
Liner Glove (2 pairs) - These gloves keep the inside of your mitts or
other gloves from accumulating sweat on the inside and turning
inside out when you take them off, as well as provide additional
insulation.

Eddie Bauer Mountain Glove
Lightweight Glove - All-around gloves for mountaineering,
backcountry skiing, and hiking. These gloves (and similar options)
are warm, wind-resistant, durable and have a sure grip. You will rarely
take these gloves off. They should be snug-fitting, and have some
sort of reinforced palm. The Black Diamond basic work glove is also
recommended.

Eddie Bauer Guide Glove
Midweight Gloves - These gloves should be full GORE-TEX¬Æ, and
insulated. These will be your main glove for the trip until summit days,
or when it gets especially cold. Black Diamond Spark or Punisher are
also recommended.

Big Mountain Mittens - These mittens should be warm and worn
over a liner glove. Down mittens are not required. You should choose
a pair that allows you to still operate locking carabiners.

Ice Breaker Hike Liner Crew
Liner Socks (3 pair) - A super-thin wicking sock that repels moisture.
Liner socks help to reduce the likelihood of blisters. The socks should
be thin wool, nylon, or Capilene¬Æ. NO COTTON.

Hiking Socks (3 pair) - Your everyday sock, good for day hikes,
trekking, and in- town. NO COTTON.

Patagonia Ultra HW Mountaineering

scrambles decently on rock. A Gore-tex lined shoe stays drier when
hiking in rain or snow. La Sportiva trail running shoes also

Base Camp Boots - These snow boots are good for wearing around
camp and should be comfortable when you slip into them after
spending significant time in your mountain boots.

hiking boot for moderate to rugged terrain with light/moderate
backpacking loads to a light mountaineering boot.

expedition weight top, but not as extreme as your big puffy jacket.
Full zip is recommended. Patagonia R1 Jacket also recommended.

Eddie Bauer Ignitelite
Synthetic Jacket - A simple, lightweight synthetic jacket. This item is
good for layering systems and the Primaloft keeps you warm when
wet.

Eddie Bauer Sandstone

that those who don‚Äôt have one wish they did! More breathable than
Gore-tex, these jackets block wind and light precipitation. A windshirt
is an option for this layer. Patagonia Guide Jacket and Black
Diamond Induction Shell are also options.

Eddie Bauer Neoteric Shell
Gore-Tex¬Æ jacket - A lightweight, waterproof and breathable jacket
WITH A HOOD that can withstand extreme weather conditions. Make
sure you have pit-zips and if you are using an old jacket, rewaterproof
it. Patagonia M10 jacket is also an option.

Eddie Bauer XV Down Jacket
Down parka - A puffy jacket with a hood that will keep you warm
during the coldest of conditions. The higher the quality down, the
better (800-fill is best). However, be sure the jacket is still lightweight.

Down Suit - We HIGHLY recommend an 8000m insulated suit rather
than separate top and bottom.

Eddie Bauer Guide Pro Short
Quick-dry shorts - Throw these on under other layers for when the
sun begins to beat, or you have a sudden urge to jump in a glacial
lake. Lightweight, durable and comfortable. NO COTTON. Patagonia
Baggies Shorts also recommended.

also recommend Patagonia- Capilene 2 Bottoms and Icebreaker
200/260 weight.

Expedition-weight bottoms - Fitted, light-weight and quick drying.
The mid-weight will be a base-layer that will get you through a wide
range of temperatures. Also recommended: Patagonia Capilene 4
pants.

Eddie Bauer Guide Pro Alpine
Soft Shell pants - You will spend most of your days in these pants.
Choose Schoeller¬Æ or a soft-shell equivalent. Breathable + waterresistant.
These pants should have an ankle zip so they will
accommodate your mountain boot. Also recommended: Patagonia
Alpine Guide Pant.

Light Soft Shell pants - A lighter, more breathable version of the
standard soft shell pants, will be key for aerobic hiking. Choose
Schoeller¬Æ or a soft-shell equivalent. Breathable + water-resistant.

mountain boot.

  description: "Altitude Junkies offer one of the most cost-effective full-service expeditions on Everest.
We don't advertise an expedition price and then ask for additional payments at the conclusion of the expedition such as Sherpa summit bonus and kitchen staff gratuities as some of the other operators do. The price you pay the Junkies is the final price.
Our expedition is limited to six climbers and an expedition leader with a 1:1 Sherpa to climber ratio. Some of the other operators have as many as twenty climbers on one expedition and we feel a smaller team makes for a more intimate and satisfying experience for a climber on Everest.",

  title: "Mt Everest",
  description: "At 29,035 feet (8,850 meters), Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world. Inevitably, Mount Everest was the object of fascination long before Westerners began to climb the mountain. The Tibetans call it ‚ÄúChomolungma,‚Äù which translates to ‚Äúmother goddess of the world,‚Äù and the Nepali word is ‚ÄúSagarmatha,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúchurning stick in the sea of existence.‚Äù It was officially named after Sir George Everest (the British surveyor-general of India in 1859), and in 1953 Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay made history when they became the first known climbers to reach the summit.
In the spring of 2018, Benegas Brothers Expeditions will run their fourteenth expedition to Mount Everest. We‚Äôll be offering a variety of trips, and the most ambitious will culminate in a summit attempt via the South Col.
In our expeditions, we bring together the best components of high altitude mountaineering. On a BBE expedition, you‚Äôll benefit from our many years of experience, our world-class guides, and the most professional Sherpa team in the industry. We also work hard to utilize new technology and equipment advancements, including the latest weather forecasting facilities, safety equipment, and communications systems. We can confidently say that our expedition offers you the most respected staff, resources, food, and base camp support available. Our regular Dream Team returns for 2018 ‚Äì Willie Benegas (12 summits), Damian Benegas (5 summits) and our Base Camp Manager Georgie Davenport (Paramedic, 4 seasons)
If you‚Äôd like to join us on the highest summit in the world, then you‚Äôve come to the right place. We believe that the ascent should be made in the best supported style possible, a philosophy that has helped our expedition members achieve one of the highest rates of success on Mount Everest and secured our reputation as the best expedition on the mountain, year after year.",

Pack and Bags
2 Duffle Bags- At least one bag should be extremely durable,
waterproof, and big! You should feel comfortable leaving it in a
puddle for several hours. Remember dry clothes are hot
commodities in the mountains! Large enough to fit everything you
own, plus what you anticipate buying.

1 Small duffle bag (bag stays in Kathmandu locked away with city clothes)

Trekking or Day Pack. (Optional but recommended). Small
pack approx. 25 to 35 liters for trek in with water bag
included. Camel bag, type hydration bag

Expedition Backpack. Internal frame pack expandable to 65 to 75
liters Keep it simple and light; avoid unnecessary zippers, etc., which
add weight.


Hydration System- Must have shoulder straps + be insulated. Should
carry 70-100 ounces. This will be worn under your gore- tex layer
(not in your pack) on summit days, so choose the lowest profile
model you can find.

Sleeping
Sleeping bag: Expedition quality rated to a least - 20F. Goose down
preferred over synthetic for bulk& weight. Your bags needs to be
long enough that your feet are not pressing out the foot box which
will make you colder

Second, Sleeping Bag. (Expedition quality rated to a least
-40F. Goose down preferred over synthetic for bulk and
weight. This heavier bag stays in for Base Camp, to avoid
the need of carrying the bag up and down the mountain
after the higher camps are established

Sleeping pad: Closed foam: full length

2 x Sleeping Pad: 72 inch long self inflatable pad 1 base camp and 1
for high camps. Make sure you also purchase and bring a repair kit +
bag for the sleeping pad.

Compression Stuff Sacks: Work very well for reducing volume of
sleeping bags and bulky down clothing


Technical Equipment
Ice Axe: w/Leash. General mountaineering tool. Sizing is important:
under 5‚Äô7‚Äù use a 60cm tool; 5‚Äô7‚Äù- 6‚Äô1‚Äù use a 65cm tool; over 6‚Äô1‚Äù use a
70cm tool. (Too short is preferable to too long) Make sure that you
have a leash that is designed for use on a glacier axe. Please no
technical leashes designed for technical ice climbing-they are too
short, heavy and not versatile

Crampons: The 12 point adjustable crampons designed for general
mountaineering are ideal. Rigid frame crampons designed for technical
ice climbing are not recommended. Carry any repair kit/ replacement
parts and adjusting tools which are specific to your crampons.

Harness: Must have belay loop, gear loops and adjustable leg
loops so that you can layer up underneath it. Easy to pack,
lightweight + comfortable.

Helmet: A lightweight climbing helmet. Must be UIAA approve

Carabineers (3 locking carabineers and 3 non-locking
carabineers) Lightweight small carabineers are best. Nonlockers
can be wire gates.

left hands

PERLON (40 feet of 6mm and 6 feet of 3mm) - Will be used to
make prussiks, ‚ÄúTexas hitch systems‚Äù, and ‚Äúdummy‚Äù straps. This
cord should be uncut and not Kevlar.

Ski /trekking poles: Adjustable, 3 section. Shock absorbers are
not recommended.

2 headlamps- L.E.D; headlamps are recommended. Make sure
they have 3+ bulbs. Bring extra batteries. We highly
recommend a tilting lamp

GLACIER GLASSES- Should have very dark lenses (85%+ visible
light blocked). Minimal light should come in below, above, or
around the sides of the lenses. Glasses with leather/plastic side
shields or ‚Äúbug- style‚Äù wraps are best. Ventilation is also
important. Be sure to have a retainer strap (Chums or
Croakies).

GOGGLES- These will only be worn during extreme weather
conditions. Make sure you are getting a snug fit with light
color lenses. 100% UV & IR protection Ventilation + anti-fog
features are recommended

Spare sunglasses

Footwear
3 Pairs trekking socks: Lightweight-hiking socks for the trek
to Basecamp.

3 Pairs warm socks -- A wool synthetic blend. Pure rag wool

retaining their shape and reducing blisters. NO COTTON

Light hiking boots or trekking shoes. For day hikes and trek
to Base Camp. The trail to Base Camp is rocky and rough.
Light weight, high comfort, plenty of room in the toe bed,
and good support should be stressed here.

Mountaineering Boots: Select a brand‚Äôs ‚Äútop of the line ‚Äú
model. The boot needs to be roomy enough to allow for
good circulation . Anticipate a shock combination when
sizing them ( single sock, liner and heavy sock, or two two
heavy socks on each foot). Wear the boots as often as
possible before the climb, to determine proper fit, comfort
and performance.

MOUNTAINEERING BOOTS: Hybrid boots are the preferred
choice They provide the best insulation as well as a more
rigid sole for kicking steps and holding crampons. Leather
mountaineering boots that have completely rigid soles are
also adequate, but they will need to be insulated.

respiratory system when traveling in dusty conditions.

Hands
Lightweight Synthetic gloves: Should fit comfortably inside mitts or
gloves . Lither Capilene preferred

Windstopper¬Æ Glove: You will rarely take these gloves off. They
should be snug-fitting, made of Windstopper¬Æ fleece, and have some
sort of reinforced palm. We also recommend (additionally) a thinner
liner glove for optimum dexterity

parka that extends well below the waist and above the
knees. Goose down is recommended versus synthetic fill.
The parka is worn primarily in camp, at rest breaks. When
sizing a parka, allow for several layers to be worn
underneath; buy it large. The parka must have an insulated

  route: "There are innumerable books and articles published on the South Col route providing a surfeit of information, so we include here only a summary of the route. Base Camp is situated at 5,300 meters at the foot of the Khumbu Ice Fall. Above lies the famous constantly moving icefall, which needs to be fixed with ropes and ladders. A Sherpa team arranged by Sagarmatha National Park will equip the icefall for all teams to use.
Camp 1 is located at the top of the icefall at about 6,100 meters. The Western Cwm opens out in front of us with the South West Face of Everest and Lhotse coming completely into view for the first time. It is an easy but long walk up into the Western Cwm to Camp 2 winding our way around crevasses.
Camp 2 at 6,400 meters is on a patch of moraine under the imposing South West Face. This will be our Advanced Base Camp where members can stay for extended periods between rests at Base Camp.
Another gentle slope leads to the huge Lhotse face, an ice wall of about 30 ‚Äì 40 degrees in angle. Rope will be fixed on this. Halfway up at about 7,400 meters we will place Camp 3.
Continuing up the Lhotse Face we pass the rocks of the Yellow Band then traverse left towards the South Col at just under 8000 meters where we place Camp 4.
The Summit
Summit day follows the lower slopes of the South East Ridge climbing long snow slopes to reach the Balcony, a prominent feature on the route. Above this the route climbs the flank of the ridge to the South Summit, climbing occasional short rock steps. From the south summit the ridge is traversed to the foot of the Hillary Step. This famous obstacle must be overcome before the final gentle slope to the summit.
The Role of the Sherpa: on summit day Sherpas will be assigned to members to provide support and to carry additional oxygen for members.
The Climbing Programme
The approach to Base Camp from Kathmandu is a time when team members can get to know one another and enjoy the comforts of the Khumbu region. An extensive network of high quality lodges means that it is now possible to trek all the way to Everest Base Camp without having to camp en route. The initial approach to Base Camp takes approximately ten days and allows us to acclimatize properly during the slow and gradual ascent. This walk up is extremely enjoyable and many of the most famous peaks of the Nepalese Himalaya are seen. After establishing Base Camp we will spend up to a further week static acclimatizing, during which the guides will review the procedures for climbing the ladders and ropes of the Khumbu Icefall.
This will also be a time when procedures for understanding and using the oxygen breathing apparatus will be explained and tested. The initial climb through the Khumbu Icefall to Camp 1 will be hard work. After the second visit to this camp it should be possible to move up to Camp 2 / ABC. Above Camp 2 the Lhotse Face rises up to the South Col. Midway up this huge face lies Camp 3 and all members will be required to sleep at Camp 3 and descend to Base Camp before a summit attempt will be permitted. Those who wish can descend at this time as far as Pheriche village at 4,300 meters and some may wish to go even lower. This descent allows the body to recover better than at the higher altitudes and after this period of rest we return to Base Camp to prepare for the summit attempt. Now suitably acclimatized we move through the camps in quick succession (weather permitting) and climb to Camp 4 at the South Col. Some members may wish to use supplemental oxygen for the ascent to the South Col.
Summit day starts at 9pm. The guides and Climbing Sherpas will lead out the route, climbing through the night on the easier lower part of the route. Members will be required to carry the oxygen cylinder in use, whilst Climbing Sherpas will carry two additional cylinders for members to change during the summit day.
The guides will nominate a ‚Äòturn-around‚Äô time and this will be strictly enforced.",

  description: "Mountain Trip has been on Everest for almost a decade now, with a strong local team and experienced guides.  Follow the Trip Reports from the 2017 Everest Expedition

Mountain Trip‚Äôs guided Mount Everest Climbing Expeditions are professionally supported and provide the highest level of service to provide you with the best chance to succeed on this climb. An expedition to the highest peak in the world, represents in many ways the culmination of a climber‚Äôs mountaineering career. The decisions of whether or not to attempt it and with whom to go climb it are not to be taken lightly.
We lead professionally guided Mount Everest climbing expeditions to the south side of the mountain. All the logistical support and leadership necessary to make this a successful climbing expedition is included in the trip fee. Our Sherpa team is highly experienced and our American guides are the best in the industry.

Unlike many other Mount Everest climbing expeditions offered by guide services or outfitters providing logistical support, our expedition does not contain any hidden costs, extras or add-ons. We know that an undertaking like this is very stressful and we attempt to remove as much of the potential stress that is under our control as possible in order to allow our Everest climbers to focus on the task of climbing the highest mountain in the world.

Our Everest climbing expedition will provide all the leadership and logistics necessary to climb Mt. Everest via the SE Ridge route on the Nepal side. This route has the highest success rate on the mountain. We have our own luxurious base camp, Sherpa cooks and staff. Highly supported, this team will consist of a maximum of 4 climbers per American guide, and will be supported by an average of two Sherpas per climber. This depth of Sherpa experience, coupled with low ratios of Mountain Trip guides gives our climbers an industry high level of support on the mountain.

Logistical preparations are paramount on a guided Everest climbing expedition, and our experience and that of our team will provide you with unmatched support. This is a great opportunity for qualified climbers to join a very well organized Everest trip with a proven and experienced Sherpa team, base camp services, oxygen systems, high-tech communications, and medical support. If the weather cooperates and you put in the proper training that such an endeavor requires, we feel that our acclimatization schedule and leadership will provide you with the best possible chance for reaching the summit.

Family or Friends interested in joining the trek to Everest Base Camp?  They can join a trek with the team and enjoy the excitement of the journey, without the climb.  Check out this option on our Everest Base Camp Trek page.

Anyone considering an attempt on Mount Everest should contact Mountain Trip as far in advance as possible for additional information and to help us better determine if this is an appropriate decision for you to make at this time.",
  gearlist: "
  Booties	Synthetic or down fill booties both work well on expeditions. These are great for camp and tent comfort and allow you extra opportunity to dry out your mountain boots. Booties are generally considered optional, but we really recommend them for West Buttress expeditions.
Sierra Design's Down Booties

Light Hiking Shoes	Comfortable, well broken in trekking shoes or light weight boots are critical, as we will hike a lot of miles in them before we start the climb. Look for breathable shoes, but it can rain and/or snow, so a gore tex line shoe/boot is not a bad idea. Some people prefer a light trail running shoe, but if you haven't spent a lot of time in them a more supportive shoe may be more appropriate.
La Sportiva Synthesis
La Sportiva Trango Trek Wmn's
La Sportiva Trango Trek Men's
Warm Boots for Base Camp	Optional, but it is nice to have a good pair of comfy, warm boots for hanging out in base camp. Ugg boots are great!
Socks	Bring 8 - 10 sets of light, medium and heavy weight socks, as you will want a variety for versatility. Make sure they fit in your boots and hiking shoes.
Crocs	Crocs make a great lodge/camp shoe. They are lightweight and versatile, you can wear them with a sock in the evening, and even use them for a shower shoe.
Crocs
Mountain Boots 8000 Meter Peaks	When you are going to extreme altitudes, you can't skimp on equipment, particularly your boots. There are several companies that make great boots for 8000 meter peaks, including the LaSportiva Olympus Mons, and the Millet Everest boots. These are insulated boots with a warm removable liner and built in, insulated overboot. Make sure these fit you well, not at all tight, but you don't need to oversize too much. We also recommend getting a battery powered boot warmer as some extra insurance for the toes!

Torso Layers


Expedition Parka	Patagonia, Feathered Friends, Mountain Hardwear, Marmot, and The North Face all make good parkas. There are some synthetic options; however, down is recommended as it is lighter and less bulky. You do not need a full-on 8000meter parka for peaks like Denali and Aconcagua, but you should have a warm one with a hood. A suitable parka will be built with -box baffled construction.-
Patagonia Fitz Roy Down Parka
Base Layer Top	(1 or 2 sets) Synthetic layers work well, such as Capilene 2 or 3 from Patagonia. There are some really nice Merino wool options on the market as well. One set it sufficient for most expeditions and for overnight trips, however; the choice as to whether to bring a second set is a personal one, based on your level of comfort with wearing the same clothes for days or weeks at a time.
Patagonia Base Layer Top
Light Fleece Top	You'll want a light fleece top in a weight similar to Thermal Weight Capilene Hoody, or the warmer R1 Hoody from Patagonia. A rather deep zip t-neck really helps with ventilating and we are fans of a hooded version for this layer.
Capilene Thermal Hoody
R1 Hoody
‚ÄúPuffy‚Äù Light Insulated Jacket	Size this layer to fit over your light fleece and wind shell. We are fans of the puffy Primaloft insulated jackets because they are lighter and warmer than thick fleece and compress down much smaller. A hood on this layer is mandatory.
Black Diamond Hot Forge Hooded Jacket
Hard Shell Jacket	This jacket should be large enough to go over your light puffy jacket layer. You do not need the burliest/heaviest Gore-Tex jacket you can find, and we prefer the lightest weight versions.
Patagonia M10 Jacket
Soft Shell Wind Jacket	Many high alpine peaks are cold and dry. If you are not getting rained on or experiencing wet snow, perhaps you do not need a waterproof jacket? We are huge fans of very lightweight softshell wind jackets for high, dry, cold peaks. Weighing just a few ounces, these can be carried in your pocket or in the lid of your pack for rapid deployment. A soft shell is a highly breathable layer that still cuts most, if not all of the wind, but is not as waterproof as a GoreTex shell. Some trips require a hard shell down low when you may experience rain or wet snowfall, but can be climbed using soft shells higher up on the mountain when you just need to cut the wind and keep a little snow off and can save you a half a pound or more. These soft shell jackets are not a substitute for a waterproof shell jacket, but can be very nice when your concern is wind and snow.
Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody
‚ÄúT‚Äù or Sun Shirt	Synthetic or synthetic/cotton blend shirts are nice for hiding from the sun. Long sleeve -sun hoodies- are becoming increasingly popular, as they provide a high level of sun protection. Other people favor ventilated, button up shirts- either long or short-sleeved. Whatever you choose, consider it as part of your system, and try it out before your trip.
Down Suit	You are spending a lot of money to go to a cold and extreme environment. A Down Suit is an important piece of equipment and you'll be living in it above 7500 meters. Summit day begins in the dark and at such high altitudes, it can be difficult to stay warm. Consider down-sizing your suit a full size or more smaller than you typically wear as most of them fit large.
Base Camp Clothing	We spend a lot of time in base camp so make sure you have a pair of extra clothes. Jeans and a cotton t-shirt work fine and it‚Äôs nice to get out of synthetics for a change!
Sun Hoody (optional)	A Sun Hoody is a great lightweight layer to help protect you from the intense UV at high altitude. It's a go-to layer for our guides, as it both keeps the sun off your skin and helps keeps you cool. Highly recommended, but **OPTIONAL
Patagonia Sunshade Technical Hoody Men's
Patagonia Sunshade Technical Hoody Women's
Light Down Shirt (optional)	A light -Down Shirt- layer is a great way to add some warmth to your layering system for very minimal weight. The Patagonia Down Shirt weighs only 9.6oz and when layered under your puffy jacket adds significant warmth. For cold expeditions like Mount Vinson, or early season (April and early May) Denali expeditions, or 8000 meter peaks, an extra layer like this is great insurance against the cold, and provides nice layering options without getting a heavier down/puffy jacket. Use this instead of a vest on these colder trips, or to add warmth to a light Puffy Jacket layer. **(OPTIONAL)
Patagonia Down Shirt
Leg Layers

Gear	Description	Guide's Pick
Base Layer Bottoms	Lightweight synthetic or Merino wool bottoms are a good choice for this layer. Synthetic seems to wick a bit better and is the choice of most of our guides, but Merino tends to be more fragrance-free, and many people appreciate that quality. One pair is sufficient for overnight climbs and most expeditions, even longer climbs such as Denali and Aconcagua. Everest climbers should bring two pair.
Mens Capilene Lightweight
Womens Capliene Lightweight
Light Fleece Bottoms	As the air thins and the wind picks up, you'll want a bit more insulation on your legs. Light fleece bottoms, such as the Thermal Weight Capilene bottoms from Patagonia are breathable and have a broad comfort range, so you can wear them all day long, even if the sun pokes out from the clouds. If you tend to run cold, consider thicker fleece, such as Powerstretch from Polartec, which most outdoor clothing manufacturers also use.
Men's Thermal Weight Capilene
Women's Thermal Weight Capilene
Soft Shell Pants	We are fans of soft shell pants for use in the mountains. Also known as stretch-woven pants, these are breathable and comfortable enough to wear day in and day out on most expeditions. They cut most of the wind and are water resistant, meaning you can often use them in place of waterproof (not very breathable) hard shell pants on many climbs. On peaks like Denali and Aconcagua, you can wear them in lieu of your hard shell pants for much of the expedition.
Patagonia Dual Point Alpine Pants
Patagonia Simul Alpine Pants Womens
Hard Shell, Waterproof Pants	If there is a probability or good possibility of getting wet, you will need to have waterproof breathable pants. Also known as Hard Shell Pants, these should be as light weight as possible, and should have fully separating side zippers, so you can put them on and remove them over your boots. Gore Tex is commonly used, but there are a number of other materials that work fine. On some peaks, you might carry hard shell pants for the lower mountain, but switch to soft shell pants for the colder and drier upper mountain.
Patagonia Torrentshell Pants (M)
Patagonia Torrentshell Pants (W)
Down or Puffy Expedition Pants	On summit day or on a cold morning, having a warm layer to pull on over all your other leg layers is important. This layer should be down or synthetic (ie. Primaloft) filled and must have fully separating side zippers. Practice putting them on and taking them off while wearing your boots before you leave for your expedition.
Mountain Hardwear Compressor Pants
Underwear	Consider synthetic or Merino wool for your underwear. Most longer trips, such as Aconcagua or Denali, typically require 3-4 pair, but choose your quantity based on your personal level of comfort. Ladies might consider bringing additional pairs.
Lightweight Softshell Trekking Pants	A lightweight synthetic softshell pant is a great layer that you'll wear every day on a trek. These are water resistant, breathable and comfortable in a wide range of weather and temps.
Patagonia Simul Alpine Pant
Head and Hands

Gear	Description	Guide's Pick
Heavyweight Gloves	Warm, insulated gloves are the day-to-day workhorses on cold peaks or for cold days of ice climbing. We prefer gloves with removable liners for ease of drying. It‚Äôs hard to stress how much you‚Äôll be wearing these, so do not skimp on this item. Gloves should fit snugly, but not be too tight, and try them out before you purchase them, as some brand name gloves have pretty terrible dexterity.
Black Diamond Guide Gloves
Medium Weight Gloves	Mid-weight gloves have become increasingly popular in recent years, gaining traction on the traditional heavyweight gloves as the go-to hand protection on many trips. Appropriate gloves generally have a soft shell exterior with light synthetic insulation .
OR StormSensor Glove
Light Weight Gloves	When the sun comes out on a glacier, the temperature can soar. Light weight, soft shell gloves are great for keeping the sun off your hands, while still giving you a bit of protection from the wind and cold.
Black Diamond Pilot Glove
60 Second Gloves	Very light weight, liner-style gloves have earned the nickname -60 Second Gloves- on cold mountains, because you can wear them under your mittens to provide a modicum of protection for briefly pulling your hands from your mitts in order to perform tasks like clipping ropes through carabiners. Choose the lightest synthetic or Merino wool gloves you can find, and consider them to be somewhat disposable, as they are not generally very durable.
Smartwool Liner Glove
Buff Neck Gaiter	Buff is a brand of light weight neck gaiters that have grown to become a staple of every guide's kit. These are amazingly versatile, and can be worn as a hat, a neck gaiter or pulled over your face for protection from the wind or sun. They come in many thicknesses nowadays, but we prefer the original weight for its versatility.
Buff
Summit Mittens	Thick, warm mittens made from down, synthetic fill, or a combination of insulation are crucial for summit morning on many big, cold mountains. Most come with some form of retention straps, which can help reduce the chance of losing them to a gust of wind or in the event of a fall. Select a pair that fit well, with enough room to wiggle your fingers, but not so big that you cannot perform basic tasks while wearing them. Good mittens are expensive, but how much is one finger worth?
Outdoor Research Alti Mitts
Warm Hat	Bring one warm hat or two hats of different weights. Wool or fleece are fine, but your hat must provide ear protection from the cold.
Sun Hat	Baseball type or wide brimmed sun hats are required for protection against the intense sunshine found on many peaks. You can combine a baseball hat with a bandana for good sun protection or go for a wide brimmed version to protect your face, ears and neck.
OR Helios Hat
Hand Warmers	Bring 4 -6+ sets of these disposable insurance policies, depending on where you are climbing. Make certain that your hand warmers are relatively new, as they do go bad over time.
Glacier Glasses	Glacier glasses are most commonly used on big mountains, but some wrap around, sport-style glasses also work well. Whichever you bring, they must have side protection and filter 100% UVA and UVB rays. Increasingly, sun glasses are divided into categories of light transmission, and for snowy or glaciated climbs, you will want glasses rated to Category 3 or higher.
Julbo Explorer Alti Spectron 4 Sunglasses
Ski Goggles	These are necessary for use while traveling during storms or during really cold spells. These must have double lenses and provide full UV protection. Fogging is a real challenge, so the ‚ÄúTurbo Fan‚Äù goggles are worth the investment! Select a general purpose lens that will provide some protection in bright light, but not be so dark as to make them useless on a cloudy or flat-light day.
Smith Phenom Turbo Fan Goggle with Red/Sol X Lens
Nose Guard	Beko makes nice nose protectors that keep the wind and sun from wreaking havoc on your skin.
Clear Lens Goggles	At 8000 meters it can be cold and windy, and we'll be climbing at night, so a pair of goggles or glasses that protect your eyes from the cold and wind is important. When the sun comes out, you will need a pair with UV protection. You can switch the lenses in most goggles so you may be able to bring just an extra lens, but make sure you've practiced switching and can do it in challenging conditions! Several manufacturers make -photochromic- lenses that get darker in bright light, but they may not be light enough to use in the dark.
Sleeping Gear

Gear	Description	Guide's Pick
Inflatable Sleeping Pad	Inflatable pads have improved tremendously in recent years. Whether you choose a self inflating pad or one that requires some pumping to inflate, select a pad that is warm and comfortable.
Exped Downmat UL 7
Foam Sleeping Pad	Bringing two sleeping pads, one closed cell foam and the other an inflatable pad, will provide additional comfort and insulation, as well as a bit of insurance in case you have a catastrophic failure of your inflatable pad.
Ridge Rest SOLite (Reg)
Second Sleeping Bag	This is Optional, but it is nice to have a second bag for base camp. This saves you from hauling your bag up and down the mountain as higher camps are established, reducing your pack weight and enabling you to move more efficiently. This bag should be rated to -20F, as it can get chilly, even at base camp!
Compression Stuff Sack	Granite Gear, Outdoor Research and others are all making nice, lightweight compression sacks. These are essential for sleeping bags and recommended for your summit clothes, such as your parka, mitts and warmest pants, so you might consider bringing two.
Granite Gear Air Compressor Sack
Sleeping Bag ‚Äì 8000 meter peaks	A good warm sleeping bag is an important piece of gear for a high Himalayan expedition. A good down filled sleeping bag is the only option, synthetics are too heavy and bulky to carry up to high altitude. You should choose a high quality bag rated to -20 to -40 degrees.
Western Mountaineering -25 degree
Marmot Col -20 degree
Western Mountaineering -40 degree
Packs and Duffels

Gear	Description	Guide's Pick
Large Zippered Duffel	You'll want an XL sized (90 ‚Äì 120L) duffel for your expedition. Lightweight and inexpensive bags work fine, although water resistant bags like the Patagonia Black Hole Bag 120L are nice for their toughness to weight ratio. A quality bag can work for a sled bag on Denali, a mule bag on Aconcagua and a great all around travel bag.
Patagonia Black Hole 120L
Everest Pack	A lightweight, 60 - 70 liter pack will work well for Mount Everest, with the emphasis on light. Look for one that weighs 4 pounds or less.
Black Diamond Mission 75
Mountain Hardwear S. Col
Climbing Gear

Gear	Description	Guide's Pick
Ski / Trekking Poles	Adjustable poles work great and are easier to travel with as they fit better in your duffel bag. Black Diamond Flick Lock poles are recommended as they are less prone to spontaneously collapsing than some of the twist-tightening versions. The small ‚Äútrekking‚Äù baskets on some poles are not large enough for use on soft snow, so make certain your poles have bigger ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù style baskets for any climb with glacier or snow travel.
Black Diamond Expedition Ski Poles
Ascender	You need one full-sized ascender such as the Petzl Ascension to clip into the fixed lines on the route, and to use for crevasse rescue applications.
Petzl Ascension Ascender
Ice Axe	A general use, mountaineering axe is sufficient for this climb. Some axes are much lighter than others, so select for weight as well as a size for your height. Most climbers do well with a 60 - 75 cm axe. On less technical routes, a longer axe can act like a walking stick on flatter terrain.
Black Diamond Raven Pro Ice Axe
Alpine Climbing Harness	Your harness should be adjustable enough to accommodate several layers of clothing. As with most items on this list, choose a light weight harness.
Black Diamond Couloir Harness
Carabiners	Bring eight regular (non-locking) carabiners. Please do not bring ‚Äúbent-gate‚Äù carabiners, as these have certain limitations that do not make them appropriate for how we will use them. Mark your 'biners with colored tape for identification.
Black Diamond OZ Carabiners
Locking Carabiners	Bring three locking carabiners. Screwgate or auto-locking 'biners work equally well, although the new magnetic gate versions seem like they might be less prone to freezing closed. Select light weight carabiners.
Black Diamond VaporLock Carabiners
Climbing Helmet	Make certain it fits over your warmest hat and under the hood of your shell. The super-lightweight foam helmets are great, but can get crushed in your duffel bags during travel, so protect your lid!
Black Diamond Half Dome Helmet
50‚Ä≤ of Accessory Cord	Perlon accessory cord, made of nylon, is useful for all manner and sort of purposes on an expedition. We'll have a good supply, but you should bring 50 feet of 6mm cord for your prussiks and other purposes.
Crampons	Select a pair of 10 or 12-point mountaineering crampons that fit your boots well. Mountaineering crampons will have horizontally oriented front points, rather than the vertically oriented ones used for ice climbing. Step-in or strap versions work equally well; just make sure they fit your mountain boots and overboots. Often, you will need to lengthen your crampons to accommodate your overboots. Please make sure you can make this adjustment in the field. Aluminum crampons are generally not acceptable for most of our expeditions. notes that the newer, stainless steel version is a lot lighter than its predecessor.
Black Diamond Sabretooth Clip
Other

Gear	Description	Guide's Pick
Stuff Sacks	We are fans of the very light stiff sacks made from Sil Nylon fabric. Bring enough for your clothes and personal items. Light, zippered stuff bags are really nice for toiletries.
OR Zip Sacks
Granite Gear Zip Sack
Two (2) One-Liter Water Bottles	You will need two, 1-liter plastic water bottles. Please bring wide-mouth bottles, such as those from Nalgene, as these are much easier to fill than bottles with small openings.
Nalgene Wide Mouth 1-Liter Bottle
Insulated Bottle Cover(s)	Water bottles freeze when it gets cold. Crazy, but true! Extra clothing can help insulate bottles, but dedicated water bottle insulators do a much better job. Bring at least one.
Large Plastic Bowl	Bowls are much easier to use and are much more versatile than are plates. Bring a 2-4 cup camping bowl or a plastic -Rubbermaid- style container for your mountain dining.
Collapsible Bowl
Insulated Cup or Mug	A 12 - 16 ounce (350-500 Ml) mug with an attached lid will help keep you hydrated. The Kleen Kanteen Insulated Bottle with the -Cafe Cap- is pretty nifty, as it is a mug and a thermos all in one!
Kleen Kanteen Insulated Bottle
Lexan Spoon	A soup spoon made from Lexan will survive most trips and is more useful and versatile than a fork or even a -spork.- Mark your spoon with your initials to keep spoon rustlers at bay.
Lip Balm (2 tubes)	Protect your lips! Bring two tubes of high quality lip balm with SPF.
P-Bottle	Wide-mouth, collapsible Nalgene Cantenes work great- they make a 96 ounce version, which will come in handy during long storms or if you take Diamox. Ladies- look for an appropriate adapter available at your local outdoors store. These items can both be tough to find in Anchorage so plan ahead!
Toiletry Kit	Tooth brush & paste, dental floss, Handi-wipes (1 per day on average), a small bottle of hand sanitizer, perhaps some foot powder‚Ä¶ keep it small!!!
Personal Medical Kit	Mountain Trip's guides will have fairly comprehensive medical kits developed by our Medical Director, but we encourage each climber to bring a small, personal kit. Items to consider bringing include: blister treatment and prevention, pain relievers, and antacids. Presctiption medications should be based on consultation with your personal physician. Suggested drugs for altitude expeditions include: Diamox (acetazolomide) 125 mg, Decadron (dexamthazone) 4 mg, Nifedipine XR 30 mg, and a couple of antibiotics for respiratory and gastrointestinal issues.
Journal (and pencil)	Expeditions can be a great time for reflection and a journal can be a nice way to wax poetic or just keep track of what you did each day. Keep it small and leave the leather bound version at home.
Book(s) or E-Reader	There is a lot of -down time- on an expedition, even when you have good weather. A book or two can help pass the time. E-Readers have gained popularity in recent years, as they enable you to have dozens (or hundreds) of books at your disposal. E-Readers present certain challenges, but can be a great way to keep your sanity during a long storm. Consider how you will recharge your e-Reader.
Camera	Small, light weight point and shoot cameras are most popular among climbers. Be sure to bring extra memory and batteries!
Altimeter Watch	An altimeter watch can be fun to have on an expedition to keep track of your ascent and to watch for changes in barometric pressure.
Suunto Vector
Lighter	Your guides will have plenty of lighters, but it is nice to have one lighter per tent, as cord always needs to be cut and melted.
Small Knife	A small knife or small multi-tool is also handy to have. One per tent is sufficient. There is emphasis on the word small when it comes to multi-tools!
Personal Music Player	iPods and the like are really nice on a long trip. At altitude, hard drive based devices stop working, so make certain that you bring a flash drive (solid state) music player. Also consider how you will keep it charged, and bring whatever is necessary to keep you in time to the beat.
Several Good Jokes!	-A Moose walks into a bar...-
SIM Card	We‚Äôll have a satellite phone and you are welcome to use it, but if you plan on making many calls, please purchase and bring your own SIM card to use. Contact us for details about which card to purchase.
Towel, Shampoo and Soap	For showers at base camp!
Sunscreen for Everest	Bring 1 large tube of sunscreen for the approach and for use in base camp, plus one or two, 1-ounce tubes for use on the mountain.
Sunscreen	The sun can be intense at altitude. Bring one small tube for use while climbing and one larger tube for use while not on route.
Water Purification System	There are many good options, and they get better every year. Pumps work well, but can be heavy. Our favorite is the relatively easy to use and lightweight water treatment drops by Aquamira. The SteriPen style water treatment is not recommended. Be certain to have enough to treat 3-5 liters per day for the duration of your trip.
Aquamira Water Treatment Drops
Headlamp	Bring an extra set of batteries, as well. Lithium batteries work the best in cold weather!!

No Guaranteed Outcomes

While it is one of our goals to help every climber on every Mountain Trip expedition reach the summit, Mountain Trip cannot guarantee that you will reach the summit.  Any number of factors, including weather, the conditions encountered on the route, your personal level of fitness or ability, the abilities of your team mate(s) or any number of other circumstances might result in you and/or your team turning around before reaching the summit.  Failure to reach the summit due to any reason associated with mountaineering, such as weather, team dynamics, route conditions, avalanche hazard, rockfall hazard, etc, or due to your lack of fitness or preparation are not the responsibility of Mountain Trip and will not result in a refund or a rescheduling of your expedition.",

  title: "EVEREST EXPEDITION - SOUTH (8848 M)",
  description: "Ask an adventurer about their dream, they will answer you with a word; EVEREST. Who would not want to reach the top of the world? Who would not want to touch the sky? It‚Äôs the trip of the lifetime, Its Everest Expedition. Mount Everest, also known as The Sagarmatha in Nepali is the tallest peak on earth with an altitude of 8848m. The southern face lies in Nepal whereas the northern face is in Tibet. In 1715, China surveyed the mountain for the first time while they were mapping Chinese territory and depicted it as Mount Qomolangma. Mount Everest was again measured by British India government in 1856 during their Great Trigonometry Survey. Back then, it was named as Peak XV and said to be 8840m tall.

Peak XV was renamed after Sir George Everest as Mount Everest, name given in his honour, who was lead surveyor in 1856. Sir George was Welsh Surveyor, he was surveyor general of India for thirteen years from 1830. The Everest has fascinated the mountaineers all around the globe since 1920s when Tibet opened the climbing in early 1920s. In 1922 British Expedition team led by Charles Bruce tried to scale the summit of Mount Everest for the first time. It was Edward Norton in his second attempt along with British Expedition team set the height of 8572m. The mountaineers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine disappeared on the third attempt. Mallory's body was found in 1999. There were several attempts made to Everest before the successful attempt made by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on 29 May 1953 via the South route. It is now reported that around 1000 ascent attempts are made every year.

We will take the southern route to the summit. This trip suits for those who has previous experiences of few 7000m peaks or even more. The real trek apparently starts from the Base Camp and to reach the base camp takes you around 7 days on foot. We will move on to Camp I (6,065m) where we will see Khumbu glacier.  From Khumbu Glacier, it around 450m on a gradual slope to Camp II (6,750m) and around 610m to Camp III (7,100m). Camp III is located at the head of Lhotse. From this point onwards, you will be needing oxygen cylinders. You will reach the Camp IV (7,910m) after just crossing 8000m elevations. This point is also known as the Death Zone.

Mount Everest Expedition is undoubtedly a lifetime opportunity. Nevertheless, this expeditions encounter many hindrances such as high altitude, severe weather conditions and avalanches. One must be well trained before actually trying it. You need to get your body ready for the 8848m foot climb to Everest's summit. Depending on your current level of fitness, you need to train for several months before you start your ascent. A climber must build his/her cardiovascular strength along with muscular strength, oxygen level drops by 60-70 percent from sea level. Also make sure you can carry big bag packs to top as you will be carrying cylinder of oxygen and large bag packs along with you. One must acclimatize with weather conditions and be prepared for rock falls, avalanches. Learning rescue techniques would be an added advantages.

 Our Air Bus , Heli Everest will all the time be supporting our team with supplying fresh - fruits,vegetables,meats and and other food items all most every day, and its also always ready for your safty at your needs.
 -We await to serve you our service and share our experience with you-",

One must acclimatize with weather conditions and be prepared for rock falls, avalanches. Learning rescue techniques would be added advantages.
  Talking about the north route, one climber notesd, the North Face is a place where a simple slip would mean death. North face expedition mainly starts from Tibet side. Chinese climbers claimed to have reached the top via north route for the first time in 1960, which was not accepted because of lacking photographic evidence. Reinhold Messner who is regarded as the greatest climber ever, he pioneered a new road on the north col/face. He trekked the Northwest route for three days only himself from his base camp at 6,500 metres without oxygen tanks for the first time in the history in 1980. In the same year Takashi Ozaki and Tsuneo Shigehiro become the first to scale Mount Everest from the North Face. Climbing from the North side is a perfect opportunity to see how you perform at an extreme altitude. North Face-NE Ridge is a perfect choice to make the success happen without less crowd comparing to south every year. You will do several rounds of practice climbing to acclimatize before actual climbing to the top.
  The Base camp is situation just below the Rongbuk Monastery. It is about 20 km trek to reach the Advanced Base Camp (ABC). ABC is situated on rugged and fragmented ground with high speed winds welcoming you. From ABC to East Rongbuk Glacier, it‚Äôs fairly easy, following the snowy slopes to the North col, you will reach Camp I. The camp I rests between Everest and Changtse. Following long snowy slope, you will reach the camp II. The course from camp II to camp III is very stormy.
  Topography here is made up of rocks which look fairly simple but a slip here means death. However, there are ropes in place which gives some senses of safety. From camp III, climbers will feel the need of oxygen, the route from camp III to camp IV is mixture of rocky steps.
  On this way you will find fixed ropes which will lead you to right direction to the mountain. Camp IV is small camp; you will want to spend as little time here as possible. You will continue onto the North East Ridge, where you will encounter the first obstacle known as the first step. First step is rock structure about 30 meters high. Some steep rock climbing will lead you to second steps, second step is the most challenging of all the obstacle.
  This is about 40m in height. Another tough rock climbing sessions, you will reach to third step. Third step is the easier of all and has height of 25m. After completing all three obstacles you will land on Summit Pyramid, From here you will see the shining crystals from top of the world.",
